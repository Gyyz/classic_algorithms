# Branch and Bound (0/1 Knapsack)

Branch and bound is a framework for exploring solution spaces while using bounds to prune suboptimal branches. This demo solves 0/1 knapsack.

Key ideas:

- Branch: include or exclude an item.
- Bound: optimistic upper bound to prune.
- Track best feasible solution found so far.
