# RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)

Algorithm to robustly estimate model parameters from data with outliers by iteratively fitting to random minimal samples and validating with inlier counts.

Key ideas:

- Random minimal sample selection.
- Consensus via inlier thresholding.
- Model refinement on consensus set.
