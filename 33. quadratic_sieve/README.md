# Quadratic Sieve (QS)

The quadratic sieve is a modern integer factorization algorithm, second fastest in practice after the number field sieve, and typically best for integers under ~110 digits.

Note:

- A full implementation is complex and lengthy.
- This module provides a stub and references for further development.
