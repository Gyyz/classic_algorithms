# LLL Algorithm (Basic Educational Version)

The Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász (LLL) algorithm reduces a lattice basis to one with shorter, nearly orthogonal vectors.

Key ideas:

- Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization to compute projections.
- Size reduction and Lovász condition.
- Iteratively swap and reduce until stable.

This demo handles small integer bases.
